These are the assignments I've done using Python in CENG111 Introduction to Computer Eng. Concepts course at METU. 
It was my first time attempting to code anything and my solutions to the given problems are very messy.
Still, this is where I started my programming journey and I'm happy to see the progress I made through the years :)
