These are the "Take-Home-Exam" assignments I've done using ANSI C in CENG 140 C Programming course. 
Trying to grasp the concept of pointers and getting a deeper understanding of the compiler itself was a fun experience.
Whilst taking the course I realized that I really enjoyed tackling programming problems, especially in C.
